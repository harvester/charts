description: A Helm chart for Harvester CSI driver

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application
keywords:
  - infrastructure
  - harvester

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 0.0.0-dev

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.

  # A SemVer range of compatible Kubernetes versions, just like Helm's kubeVersion.
  # The difference is that ours will only hide the chart in the dashboard UI, and still
  # allow users to edit (helm upgrade) the chart; the helm's kubeVersion disables edit in installed charts.
